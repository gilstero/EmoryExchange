OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION FOR EAGLE EXCHANGE BACKEND
--------------------------------------------------

cs370/cs370/urls.py:
This file defines all API endpoints available in the project. Some routes require authentication and are marked with the 'auth' tag in the URL path.
Endpoints with the 'auth' prefix require a valid Bearer token passed in the request header. These tokens are issued with a 1-day expiration (time delta).

For a full list of endpoints and their mappings, refer to the urls.py file.

cs370/cs370/settings.py:
The backend is configured as a standard Django project with minimal third-party packages.
Before starting the backend server, you must apply database migrations:

    cd cs370
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

This ensures all models are properly created and synced with the database.

cs370/members/admin.py:
This file provides Django admin interface configurations, allowing admins to manage the SQLite database through a visual UI without needing to send POST requests.

To access the admin panel, create a superuser:

    python manage.py createsuperuser

Follow the prompts to enter your credentials.

cs370/members/models.py:
This file defines all database models for the project.
Implemented models:
- User
- Listing
- Message

The Ride model is still a work in progress and may not fully represent its intended functionality.

cs370/members/serializer.py:
Serializers are kept minimal and focused. JSON and form-data payloads are handled using straightforward serializer definitions that convert data to and from Django models.

cs370/members/views.py:
This file contains the backend logic for all view functions and class-based views, corresponding to each endpoint.
Implemented views include:
- Login/logout
- Listing operations (create, update, fetch)
- Profile-related views
- Messaging features

View-specific explanations can be found in the in-file comments.
